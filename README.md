# Introduction

This Google Chrome extension restores the original content settings
functionality as it existed throughout Chrome 23 and Chrome 41.
Previously, Chrome's OIB (Origin Info Bubble), accessed by activating
the icon preceding the URL in the address bar, provided an extensive
list of permission for various content types and activities that can be
toggled, such as the ability to block Javascript and images for the
currently viewed site. This extension restores this functionality as
close as possible to how it originally functioned.
